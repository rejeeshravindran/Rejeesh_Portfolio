Actionable Insights

Jim - Highest call taker
Dan - Highest average talk duration
Dan-  Highest Answer Rate
Martha - Highest customer Satisfaction Rating

There is high call reduction starting from February month.
Agent Performance Quadrant helps us to understand the Agents who went above or below average Talk time and call count.
Call Rate/Hour graph in the given time period helps us to understand the peak hours so we can advise the agents to not take breaks, In case if agents have assigned breaks we must ensure that the work load should be properly allocated to others for handling the peak hours.
Technical support has high abandoned rate.
We are having slightly high abandoned calls for technical support topics. we must always ensure the abandoned calls details must be pulled out everyday and should call back the customer.
Martha has high satisfaction rating and those agents should be praised and we also need to study their approach to train others in improving the services.
Agents with talk time above average should undergo training also agents with high abandoned rate, high speed of answer and low satisfaction rate should strictly be monitored.
